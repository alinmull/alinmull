  Hello! I'm Alicia Mullings, and I'm primarily interested in website development with a personal focus on fun, engaging projects. I'm always strengthening my skills in website and development, especially
as a fresh graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science. 

  Outside of programming, I also dabble in knitting and writing, and one of my other big interests are various adoptable pet-sites (like Flightrising, most famously). 

  I can be reached mostly by email (anmullings3@gmail.com)
